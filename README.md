# Retailer-X-Clustering-K-Means-and-Hierarchical-Clustering

# Task Description

As part of the business objectives that you set for Retailer X, you must help Retailer X understand who their customers are so that they can more
effectively target and message them. To achieve this task, use clustering techniques to divide the Retailer X customer base into groups that are profiled,
named, and meaningful for Retailer X.

In Course, “Data Understanding and Preparation,” you derived a new view for customers by using new derived features such as total spent and total spent per 
product categories. These features are the starting point from which you are going to perform cluster analysis. In the following subsections, you re-create 
that view and prepare the data that is needed to conduct classification analysis.

In the last course, you used a prepared Jupyter Notebook to run code to replicate the results. In this course, you write code by copying the code lines in this section 
to a notebook file.

You used the K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to cluster customer data based on Income and total spending.
The resulting clusters were evaluated by data that was not used for clustering, such as age, household size, and loyalty enrollment.





# Project Introduction

Retailer X is boutique retailer with only one physical location. They believe that their niche in the market is attributable to their unique flair of affordable,
everyday items, including health and beauty, electronics, specialty treats, and apparel.

Their marketing is mostly word-of-mouth and a “surprise value” coupon that is sent to loyalty members, and an occasional coupon that is offered in support of local 
school fundraising efforts.

The retailer has interest in growing and potentially selling their products through new channels and is looking for some direction for an expansion strategy.
They heard about analytics and want to see what it can do for them.

After facilitating a workshop with the client (Retailer X), you understand that they want to know who their customers are, and how to reach the right customers
through targeted messaging:

- They want to know what factors are associated with increased levels of spending in their stores.
- They want to know what drives participation in their coupon and loyalty programs.

You learn that Retailer X recently conducted some customer research around customer satisfaction and discovered the following information:
- They were shocked to learn that poorer than expected store experience scores were driven by the stores’ failure to have the appropriate amounts of 
   stock on the shelves to meet the demands of their customers.
- They want to ensure that if they expand and experience increased demand for their products that they have the appropriate amount of stock on hand each day.



Matplotlib is a Python plotting library. It is used to generate plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, and other metrics with a few lines of code.

Scikit-learn is the popular Python machine learning library. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. With Scikit-learn, you can build classification, regression, and clustering models and do other data preparation tasks.
